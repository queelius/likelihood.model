Description: Facilitates building likelihood models. It defines a number of generic methods for working with likelihoods, and a few functions that are strictly functions of these generic methods. It is designed to interoperate well with the algebraic.mle R package. It also comes with a likelihood contributions model, a likelihood model that is composed of multiple likelihood contributions assuming i.i.d. data.
