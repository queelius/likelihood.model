Description: Facilitates building likelihood models in the Fisherian tradition.
    It defines generic methods for working with likelihoods (loglik, score,
    hess_loglik, fim) and provides functions for pure likelihood-based inference
    (support, relative_likelihood, likelihood_interval, profile_loglik). Includes
    a likelihood contributions model for heterogeneous observation types (exact,
    censored, etc.) assuming i.i.d. data.
