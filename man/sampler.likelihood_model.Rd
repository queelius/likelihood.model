\title{Estimate the sampling distribution of the MLE for a likelihood model.}
\usage{
\method{sampler}{likelihood_model}(model, df, par, ..., nthreads = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The likelihood model}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass into the likelihood model}

\item{nthreads}{The number of threads to use for parallelization}
}
\value{
A function that returns an bootstrapped sampling distribution of an
MLE.
}
\description{
We use the bootstrap method. In other words, we treat the data as an
empirical distribution and sample from it to get a new dataset, then
we fit the model to that dataset and return the MLE. We do this R
times and return the R MLEs.
}
\details{
This is the default method, but if you want to use a different method,
you should define your own method for your likelihood model.
