\title{Closed-form MLE for exponential_lifetime}
\usage{
\method{fit}{exponential_lifetime}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An exponential_lifetime model}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored)}
}
\value{
A solver function that takes (df, par, ...) and returns a
\code{fisher_mle} object. The \code{par} argument is accepted but ignored
since the MLE is computed in closed form.
}
\description{
Computes the MLE directly as lambda_hat = d / T, bypassing \code{optim}.
This demonstrates that specialized models can provide exact solutions.
